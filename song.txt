I know that you want to fuck on me baby
I got no time, baby, fuck out the way
Fuck with my brothers, I'm breaking your brain
Talk to me nice or don't talk to me, ayy (Ayy)
Ballin' for the top, I'm all in
Jumpin' from the line like Jordan
Money wanna talk, I'm all in
Money like J.P. Morgan
Psycho my neck, and my wrist going crazy
Chances of falling, I stay money shady, baby
Whatchu wanna talk about?
We can take off for the night, yeah
Baby, tell me how you want it
I'ma give it to you right on time
Tick-tock, go the clock
One hand on the blunt, other hand on the Glock
